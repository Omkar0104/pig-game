            <br>
            <br>
           Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945.[1] Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

         <b>Gameplay:</b>
         <br><br>
          (To roll the dice press ðŸŽ² button and to hold the score press HOLD button)
          Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
        
        <ul>
          <li>
          If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
          <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
          <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
          <li>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</li>
        </ul>
          For example, the first player, Player1,begins a turn with a roll of 5. Player1 could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Player1 rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Player1 rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Player2, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which Player2 chooses to hold, and adds Player2 turn total of 22 points to Player2 score.
